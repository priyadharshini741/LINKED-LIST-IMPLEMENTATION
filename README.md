I created a Linked List program using the C programming language to perform basic operations like inserting, deleting, displaying, and searching elements. I organized the code using separate functions to make it cleaner and easier to understand. I used a singly linked list, where each node holds some data and a pointer to the next node. Memory for each node is created during the program using malloc() from the standard C library. I used the GCC  compiler in the terminal on macOS to run and test the program. For writing and editing the code, I used Visual Studio Code (VS Code) with the C extension. This project helped me learn how dynamic data structures work and how pointers are used to manage memory in C programming.
